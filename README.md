<b>Introduction</b><br>
"Premier Model UI: A highly responsive fashion agency website designed with a focus on motion and typography. This project utilizes Advanced CSS3 techniques including keyframe animations, viewport-based fluid layout (vw/vh), and -webkit-text-stroke styling to create an immersive, editorial user experience."

<b>Features</b><br>
*Cinematic Hero Section: Implements a full-width background video overlay (<video> tag) with absolute positioning for text and controls.

*Infinite Scrolling Animations: Features custom CSS @keyframes animations for both the horizontal image strip and the text marquee to create continuous motion.

*Interactive Hover Effects: complex list items in the "Updates" section where images dynamically reveal and float (opacity: 1, left transition) upon hovering over text.

*Fluid & Scalable Layout: Built entirely using viewport units (vw, vh) instead of fixed pixels, ensuring the typography and layout scale perfectly across different screen sizes.

*Editorial Typography: Utilizes advanced text styling, including -webkit-text-stroke for outlined text effects and precise font positioning.
